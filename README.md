XKeyBrew helps you manage your xbox360 original backup games by automatically:  

* extracting information from backup ISO files (id, name, ...)
* downloading media data from the Internet (cover, banner, publisher, ...)
* verifying the integrity of your backups

It can also creates a dvd menu that once played through the [xkey device][xk3y] will let you choose and launch a backup on tv.
